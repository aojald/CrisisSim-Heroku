title: Financial Scam at MediCare Europe
description: >
  MediCare Europe, a healthcare network with 20 hospitals across Belgium, Spain,
  and the UK, faces a financial crisis on August 10, 2025. A key supplier,
  MedTech Solutions, emails the finance team inquiring about a $1.2 million
  payment for an invoice issued 90 days ago, claiming non-payment. Initial
  checks reveal the payment was supposedly made, raising suspicions of fraud.
  The scam threatens the company’s cash flow during a critical expansion phase,
  with potential legal and reputational fallout. C-level executives must
  investigate, contain the damage, and restore trust.
