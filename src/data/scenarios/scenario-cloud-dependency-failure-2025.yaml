title: Cloud Catastrophe at MediConnect Healthcare
description: >
  MediConnect Healthcare, a mid-sized provider operating 10 clinics across
  Belgium, Luxembourg, and the Netherlands, relies heavily on Google Cloud
  Platform (GCP) for its Electronic Health Record (EHR) system, patient
  scheduling, and telemedicine services. On August 3, 2025, at 6:00 AM, the
  production system grinds to a halt. The root cause: an expired credit card
  tied to their GCP account, unnoticed for weeks. Worse, reactivating services
  requires an MFA code sent to a phone lost two months ago by the former CFO.
  With clinics opening in hours and patients en route, C-level executives must
  navigate this cascading failure to restore critical systems and maintain care
  delivery.

      It’s 6:00 AM on August 3, 2025, a humid Monday morning in Brussels.
      MediConnect’s IT team scrambles as alerts flood their dashboards: the EHR
      system is offline, telemedicine calls drop, and patient schedules vanish.
      The CIO traces the issue to GCP, where a billing suspension notice glares
      back—payment failed due to an expired credit card, untouched since the old
      CFO left in June. Clinics are due to open at 8:00 AM, and the first wave
      of patients is already on their way. The CEO must decide how to kick off
      the crisis response as panic ripples through the team. How do you launch
      the response?
    roleContext:
      CEO: Your phone buzzes with urgent texts from the CIO and COO—time to lead.
      CFO: Newly appointed, you’re mortified this slipped through during your
        onboarding.
      COO: You envision chaos at clinics without schedules or records.
      CIO: You’ve pinpointed the GCP billing issue and dread the next revelation.
      CISO: You’re on alert for security risks tied to service restoration.
      HR Director: You brace for staff frustration as workloads spike.
      CLO: You’re already thinking of contractual obligations with GCP.
      CCO: You dread the patient backlash about to hit social media.

      By 6:45 AM, the crisis team huddles in a tense video call—except the COO,
      who’s pacing a clinic floor. The CIO logs into the GCP console, only to
      hit a wall: updating the credit card demands an MFA code sent to a phone
      number last seen in the former CFO’s hands, lost when he stormed out after
      a heated exit. Clinics buzz with early staff arrivals, oblivious to the
      ticking clock. Patients will soon demand answers. How do you tackle the
      billing block?
    roleContext:
      CEO: You need a fix—fast—to calm rising tensions.
      CFO: You curse your predecessor while digging for payment alternatives.
      COO: You’re fielding calls from clinic managers begging for EHR access.
      CIO: You’re racing to bypass the MFA snag with GCP support.
      CISO: You worry about security if access controls weaken.
      HR Director: You’re tracking down the ex-CFO’s last known whereabouts.

      At 8:00 AM, clinics open to a flood of confused patients. Without EHR or
      scheduling, staff scramble with pens and paper, squinting at faded backup
      printouts from last week. Telemedicine screens stay black, and angry calls
      pile up. GCP support confirms they’re working on it, but no ETA. The COO
      pleads for a workable interim plan as waiting rooms overflow. How do you
      manage operations in this degraded state?
    roleContext:
      CEO: You demand a practical workaround to keep clinics running.
      CFO: You tally the cost of overtime and lost telemedicine revenue.

      By 10:00 AM, social media erupts with patient complaints: “MediConnect’s
      down—where’s my appointment?” The CCO’s inbox overflows with media
      queries, and staff morale plummets as they juggle irate visitors. GCP’s on
      hold with “escalation in progress,” but the former CFO’s phone remains a
      ghost. The CEO must decide how to address stakeholders—patients, staff,
      and press—amid the storm. What’s your communication move?
    roleContext:
      CEO: You’re the face of this crisis—time to speak up.
      CFO: You’re deflecting blame while funding damage control.
      COO: You relay frontline struggles to shape the message.

      Noon strikes, and the heat in Luxembourg clinics matches the tempers in
      the war room. GCP support finally connects, but they demand manual
      identity verification—documents, signatures, and a live call—since the MFA
      phone’s a dead end. Patients are turned away, and a local news van parks
      outside the Brussels clinic. The CEO must lean on the vendor or pivot. How
      do you push GCP to restore services?
    roleContext:
      CEO: You’re ready to escalate to GCP’s top brass.
      CFO: You’re juggling funds for potential legal action against GCP.
      COO: You’re losing patience as clinics grind down.
      CIO: You’re on the line with GCP, begging for a workaround.
      CISO: You’re skeptical of rushed fixes compromising security.
      HR Director: You’re calming staff who feel helpless.

      At 3:00 PM, GCP restores partial access after a grueling verification
      dance—EHR flickers back online, but telemedicine and scheduling lag. The
      CIO warns that full recovery could take days, and backups are two weeks
      old, risking data gaps. Patients and staff teeter on exhaustion, and the
      CEO faces a fork: limp along with GCP or start a costly rebuild elsewhere.
      What’s your recovery path?
    roleContext:
      CEO: You weigh short-term fixes against long-term stability.
      CFO: You’re crunching numbers for recovery vs. migration costs.
      COO: You need systems now, not next week, for patient care.
      CIO: You’re torn between patching GCP or jumping ship.
      CISO: You demand security audits before any move.
      HR Director: You’re rallying staff for another tough shift.
