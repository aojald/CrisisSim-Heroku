title: The Voice of Deception at GreenLeaf Childcare
description: >
  GreenLeaf Childcare, a trusted provider with 30 centers across Ireland, the
  UK, and Norway, faces an unprecedented crisis on October 15, 2025. An
  adversary uses AI-generated deepfake voice calls, impersonating the CEO, to
  trick the finance team into wiring €500,000 to a fraudulent account. The scam,
  uncovered after the transfer, sparks chaos as parents question security,
  regulators loom, and the rival chain Little Sprouts gains ground. C-level
  executives must act swiftly to contain the financial loss, reassure
  stakeholders, and prevent further AI-driven attacks amidst a busy enrollment
  season.

      It’s 9:00 AM on October 15, 2025, in Dublin. The finance team buzzes with
      their usual Tuesday rhythm when the CFO’s phone rings with an urgent call
      from the bank: “Did you authorize a €500,000 wire transfer at 8:45 AM?”
      Confusion reigns—no such approval was logged. The call came from “the
      CEO,” or so the team thought, with a voice eerily identical, demanding the
      transfer to secure a “last-minute vendor deal.” The CIO traces it to an AI
      deepfake, but the money’s gone, and parents are already texting complaints
      about “weird calls.” The CEO must kick off the crisis response as trust
      wavers. How do you start?
    roleContext:
      CEO: Your voice—fake or not—has cost €500,000; you’re stunned and furious.
      CFO: You’re reeling from the financial hit and scrambling to trace the funds.
      COO: You’re fielding center managers’ reports of parent unease.
      CIO: You’ve confirmed the AI deepfake and dread more attacks.
      CISO: You’re on high alert for further AI-driven breaches.
      HR Director: You’re worried staff might fall for more scams.
      CLO: You’re eyeing fraud laws and GDPR fallout from parent calls.
      CCO: You’re bracing for a PR storm as rumors spread.

      By 10:30 AM, the crisis team huddles in a tense Cork office. The bank
      confirms the €500,000 is in an offshore account—recovery odds are slim.
      The CFO’s team scrambles to freeze further transactions, but the deepfake
      call’s sophistication suggests more attempts could follow. Centers report
      parents pulling kids, citing “security concerns.” The CEO must decide how
      to contain the financial bleeding as enrollment season teeters. What’s
      your next move?
    roleContext:

      At 1:00 PM, Oslo centers buzz with unease. Staff report odd calls—some
      claiming to be the COO, others spoofing HR—all eerily convincing. The CISO
      confirms AI voice cloning is targeting employees, likely fishing for more
      credentials. Parents hover at pick-up, grilling teachers about “scams.”
      The CEO must shield staff from further deception as morale dips. How do
      you protect your team?

      CEO: You need staff alert, not paralyzed.
      CFO: You’re funding anti-fraud measures.

      By 3:00 PM, a Bergen parent posts on X: “GreenLeaf scammed? Pulling my
      kid!” The thread explodes—hundreds of likes, angry emojis, and screenshots
      of spoofed calls. Enrollment inquiries drop as Little Sprouts runs ads
      touting “secure care.” The CCO begs for a trust-rebuilding plan as the CEO
      weighs options. How do you restore parent confidence?
    roleContext:

      At 5:00 PM, the Irish Data Protection Commission emails: “Reports of
      fraudulent calls linked to GreenLeaf—submit a breach report within 72
      hours.” The CLO confirms GDPR applies, as parent data may have fueled the
      AI attack. The bank’s fraud team also demands details. The CEO must
