description: RadiantCare Europe Ltd., a leading radiology group with 50 imaging
  centers across Germany, France, and the Netherlands, is hit by a sophisticated
  ransomware attack. The centralized PACS (Picture Archiving and Communication
  System) / DICOM system, critical for CT scanners, MRIs, and radiography, is
  encrypted, rendering diagnostic imaging services inoperable. This disruption
  poses immediate risks to patient safety, as hospitals rely on these services
  for life-saving diagnoses, potentially leading to fatalities if not restored
  quickly. Attackers have exfiltrated sensitive patient medical data and demand
  a €3 million ransom in cryptocurrency, threatening to leak the data if unpaid
  within 48 hours. The crisis begins on June 1, 2025, at 2 a.m., during a peak
  period for diagnostic imaging. Patients are scheduled for critical procedures,
  and delays could be life-threatening.

      General Context:

      RadiantCare Europe Ltd., a leading radiology group with 50 imaging centers
      across Germany, France, and the Netherlands, is hit by a sophisticated
      ransomware attack. The centralized PACS / DICOM system, critical for CT
      scanners, MRIs, and radiography, is encrypted, halting diagnostic imaging
      services. This poses severe risks to patient safety, as hospitals cannot
      perform life-saving diagnostics, potentially leading to fatalities.
      Attackers have exfiltrated sensitive patient data and demand a €3 million
      ransom, threatening to leak it within 48 hours. The crisis begins on June
      1, 2025, at 2 a.m., during a peak diagnostic period. Patients await
      critical procedures, unaware of the crisis.

      The CEO must be alerted to activate the crisis management team to restore
      IT resilience and protect patient safety. How do you activate the crisis
      management team?
    roleContext:
      CEO: You receive an urgent call from the CISO detailing the critical situation
        impacting patient safety.
      CFO: Awakened by the CEO, you anticipate financial implications of disrupted
        services.
      COO: Alerted, you focus on operational challenges to maintain imaging services.
      CIO: You work with IT to assess the attack’s scope and restore PACS resilience.
      CISO: You detected the attack, informed the CEO, and are gathering data.
      HR Director: You worry about staff stress due to patient safety risks.
      CLO: You consider legal implications of the attack and data breach.
      CCO: You anticipate communication challenges with hospitals and patients.
    options:
