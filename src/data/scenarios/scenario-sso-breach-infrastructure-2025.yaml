title: SSO Slip-Up at ConnectCore Infrastructure
description: >
  ConnectCore Infrastructure, a leading digital infrastructure provider
  operating fiber networks, data centers, and ISP services across Belgium,
  Netherlands, and Luxembourg, serves 2.3 million residential customers and
  8,500 enterprise clients. The company relies on SecureAuth (a fictitious SSO
  provider) for unified access to network management systems, customer portals,
  billing platforms, and critical infrastructure controls. On October 8, 2025,
  at 4:15 AM, SecureAuth sends an emergency notification: their authentication
  infrastructure was compromised, potentially exposing tokens for millions of
  users including critical infrastructure operators. With 24/7 network
  operations, customer services, and regulatory compliance at stake,
  ConnectCore's leadership must navigate immediate containment while maintaining
  essential digital services.

      It's 4:15 AM on October 8, 2025, when your Network Operations Center (NOC)
      receives a critical alert from SecureAuth: "SECURITY BREACH - Critical
      Infrastructure Impact." The notification reveals unauthorized access to
      their authentication systems between October 3-7, compromising OAuth
      tokens, SAML assertions, and potentially exposing access to network
      management interfaces. Your fiber network serves hospitals, government
      agencies, and financial institutions across the Benelux region. NOC
      engineers are managing routine maintenance windows, customer service teams
      are handling overnight tickets, and your data center operations continue
      24/7. The CEO must decide immediate response as the implications for
      critical infrastructure become clear.
    roleContext:
      CEO: You're weighing service continuity against potential catastrophic
        infrastructure exposure.
      CFO: You're calculating potential losses from service disruptions and regulatory
        penalties.

      trading firm with degraded performance. Social media mentions spike as
      residential customers report slow internet speeds. Your customer service
      teams are overwhelmed with calls, and your NOC identifies 23 network
      segments requiring manual intervention due to disabled automated

      Day 2, 11:00 AM: Forensic analysis reveals the full scope of the breach.
      Compromised tokens were used to access network routing configurations,
      data center environmental controls, and customer database systems. While
      no customer data was exfiltrated, detailed network topology and
      infrastructure layouts were accessed by threat actors. SecureAuth confirms
      the breach affected 15,000 organizations globally, with evidence pointing
      to state-sponsored APT groups targeting critical infrastructure. Three
      government agencies request immediate briefings, and your insurance
      company initiates a cyber-incident review. The CEO must decide on
